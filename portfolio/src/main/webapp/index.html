            <h2 id="heading">Background</h2>
                <p id="content" >
                    I grew up in Hartford, Connecticut with my mother and sister. Both of my parents are immigrants from Jamaica so culturally that's how I was raised. 
                    As a child, I enjoyed dancing, playing piano, martial arts and learning new things. I attended Jumoke Academy for elementary and Jumoke Academy Honors SMART for middle school. 
                    In middle school, I joined an after school and summer program called Hartford Youth Scholars' Stepping Stone Academy. I met some of my best friends through that program, 
                    and it helped me get into my highschool, the Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey. 
                </p>
                <p id="content" >
                    At Peddie, I was a prefect, a tour guide, leader of several organizations, and a thrower for the Track and Field team . During highschool, I became interested in the arts and 
                    as my final senior arts exhibit, I exhibited my friend group as if we were a family, with me being the grandmother. I created a living room and shot several photos of my friends 
                    in familial scenes. It was easily my favorite work. Since then, I have continued to paint and photograpgh in my free time. 
                </p>
                <p id="content" >
                    I currently attend Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. At Emory, I am the Treasurer of the Association of Caribbean Students and Educators (ACES), Sophomore Advisor for the 
                    2019-2020 year, a Residential Advisor for the 2020-2021 year, and an IMSD (Initiative for Maximizing Student Development) Scholar. I am also the founder and President of BLIS 
                    (Black and Latinx in STEM). This org is like my baby and holds a lot of significance to me. The retention rate for Black and Latinx students in STEM is low, and I have 
                    witnessed several friends change their career or major paths because they weren't successful in their STEM classes or felt like they lacked support or guidance from these departments. 
                    The goal of this organization is to create a community amongst these students, connect them with faculty and professionals in their desired fields, and help ensure their 
                    success in their fields through career development workshops and mentorship.
                </p>

                    In terms of my career path, I am a part of Girls for Technology, a Hartford-based group that introduces young women to Computer Science and Tech. Through this program, 
                    I myself was introduced to computer science and also to Google. Since then I attended Google's Computer Science Summer Institute in 2018 and was  Engineering Practicum 
                    intern the Summer of 2019 in New York.

            <h2 id="heading">Why I do Art</h2>
                <p id="content">
                    Growing up, I was never truly creative. I took a lot of art courses and after school classes  but  I never had the creative edge. However, I was always someone who enjoyed going through
                    the process of something and seeing the final results. I was always detail-oriented and that showed in many of my interests. As I got older, I saw all my interests overlap. With art, I viewed it as a
                    process and less like a creative form. Art still has a calming and stress-relieving effect on me, and still allowed me to work on my focus. When I discovered this is highschool, I held  onto it as 
                    long as I could. While I can't continue art classes in college, I have found that computer science  has taken its place. I still do art when I'm bored or whenever my body tells me it's time to 
                    paint something, but it is no longer a necessary part of my life.
