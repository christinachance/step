            <h2 id="heading">Why I do Art</h2>
                <p id="content">
                    Growing up, I was never truly creative. I took a lot of art courses and after school classes  but  I never had the creative edge. However, I was always someone who enjoyed going through
                    the process of something and seeing the final results. I was always detail-oriented and that showed in many of my interests. As I got older, I saw all my interests overlap. With art, I viewed it as a
                    process and less like a creative form. Art still has a calming and stress-relieving effect on me, and still allowed me to work on my focus. When I discovered this is highschool, I held  onto it as 
                    long as I could. While I can't continue art classes in college, I have found that computer science  has taken its place. I still do art when I'm bored or whenever my body tells me it's time to 
                    paint something, but it is no longer a necessary part of my life.

                    Travelling has always been a goal of mine. Because everyone in my family was born outside of the US, they have had various amazing experiences and adventures in other countries. 
                    I have currently been to only 3 countries, and thatâ€™s only if you count Canada as another country. So below, I have tagged all the places I have been in blue. Click a locations 
                    on the map and add where you have been in purple.
