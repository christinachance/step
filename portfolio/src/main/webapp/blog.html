                <h2>Bring Your True Self to Work</h2>
                <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, I was always told to go into a profession where I can “bring my true self to work”, but I didn’t know what that meant for me or how that could truly work. 
                        I tried bringing this motto into my academic life, trying to exist as my true self, with all of my true pains no matter who I was around, but it's hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In highschool, I went to a predominately white private school where there were only a handful of Black students in my class. That school formed a bubble around us; we 
                        never knew what was happening in the real world unless we looked at social media, and when we did we were disgusted. We needed to grieve, to reconcile, to try to 
                        understand why, but we lacked the space and support for that, so we carried on about our days, not saying much, and acting like everything was okay. Even when things 
                        happened to us, we were expected to forgive and move on. I didn’t feel like I was “bringing my true self” to my classes then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With everything that has been happening since quarantine started with the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Regis Korchinski, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, and the protests 
                        in Minneapolis, all I can think about is how Black people are supposed to act like everything is okay and like the world isn’t falling apart around us. But that’s a part of being Black. 
                        You deal with and internalize everything, and then you push all those feelings deep down inside of you, and go to class and work, and act as if you don’t fear for your life, 
                        or the life of your family and friends everyday. You put on a smile and when asked, you say “everything is okay” or “I’m fine”. You know that “bringing your true self to work” 
                        is a privilege and luxury you don't have.  
                    </p>

                <h2>You Always Need a Friend</h2>
                <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
                    <p>
                        Fall term of 2019, I decided to take 5 STEM classes: Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, and Calculus-based Physics. 
                        This in and of itself was a horrible idea. I have this habit of sitting at the front corner of all my classes, it is so I have the least amount of human interaction. 
                        I go in and out of the classes without really talking to anyone, it’s a talent. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thought that I could go on like this for the whole term, not talking to anyone and just taking notes and answering questions when they are asked, but I was far from correct. 
                        That term ended up being easily the worst term of my life. I was almost failing all the classes, I had taken up too many responsibilities, and had to deal with alot of social, 
                        familial and emotional issues. And what’s worse is throughout that first half of the term, my mother had been telling me the exact thing that would fix it, to make friends in 
                        the classes. Although it wouldn’t fix everything, I would have people to talk to about the classwork.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I naturally don’t befriend people in my classes, the friends I had in college have been made by joining group chats and organizations, so I had to go about making friends 
                        in a new way. For Physics, I definitely went into that class with friends because there is no other way to survive two terms of physics alone. In Differential, I became friends 
                        with the only person that recognized that I was dressed as Chucky from the Rugrats for Halloween. In Linear, I befriended a student from New Jersey that attended my highschool’s 
                        rival school. In Data Structures and Discrete Math, I became close friends with the girl who when scanning the class with a confused face would always be looking at me equally 
                        as confused. Having friends in these classes gave me a channel for support that I didn’t have before. Plus, their class friends became my class friends, and by the end of the 
                        term I had talked to at least half the people in my classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While that semester was still atrocious, I ended up resurrecting all of my grades and befriending several people along the way. Hopefully, they will still recognize and talk to me after quarantine. 
                    </p>
